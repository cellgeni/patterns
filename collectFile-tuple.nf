  // How to deal with a process that has a large number of input files, say
  // hundreds or thousands, for example when merging the outputs of previous tasks.
  //
  // - Use the Nextflow collectFile() operator.
  // - Nextflow will not link the input files into the work execution directory.
  // - Nextflow will create a metafile with in each line the full path name of an input file.
  // - We can control the naming of the metafile.
  // - The application in the process can use this metafile to know its inputs.
  //
  // This example is more complicated as it features collectFile() on separate
  // groups emitted fromt the same channel.

    // In a more realistic example the files in ch_f would come from
    // a process executed many times in parallel, similar for ch_g.
    // We mimic this by using the transpose() operator below.
    // This can be observed by running with -dump-channels input
